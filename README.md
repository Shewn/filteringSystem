# FilterApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.3.

## Development server

Before start a server, you must run:

```bash
npm i
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure you run in root directory.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

What you can perform using this web application:

1. Create a filter rule which used to define the filtering pattern to filter the data
2. View the filtered result
3. Modify existing rules
4. Remove existing rules

You can:

1. Modify filter-app\server\data\data.json files to determine how many data you want to display/filter
2. Modify filter-app\server\data\rules.json files to remove/initiate rules that you want to apply to the data
