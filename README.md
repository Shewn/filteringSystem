This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.3.

## Development server

Before start a server, you must run:

```bash
npm i
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure you run in root directory.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
